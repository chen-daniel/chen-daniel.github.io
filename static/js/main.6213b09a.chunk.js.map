My name is Daniel and I'm currently a Computer Science student at\n          Northeastern University with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I'm\n          passionate about building, iterating upon, and optimizing solutions\n          that put a focus on user experience. I was born in Canada, grew up in\n          Hong Kong, and studied for a year back in Canada before moving to\n          Boston. My interest in computer science was solidified during my first\n          university lecture and since then I've had the opportunity to\n          continuously grow and develop in the field. My interests currently lie\n          in full-stack web development, AI, distributed systems, game\n          development, and robotics.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Most recently I was employed as a Software Developer Co-op at Circle.\n          At this position, I have had the privilege of working with an\n          extremely experienced and talented group of developers who have helped\n          me improve as both a developer and a team member.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Outside of VS Code, I also enjoy photography (Former Canon user\n          converted to Sony), film, keeping up with tech news, gaming (Xbox\n          FTW), basketball (Go Lebron), and hip-hop dance (WOO Kinjaz).\n        </p>\n      </section>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default About;\n","import React from 'react';\n\nimport $ from 'jquery';\n\nimport './Resume.css';\n\nclass About extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      const wrapper = $('#wrapper');\n      wrapper.removeClass('is-loading');\n      const body = $('body');\n      body.removeClass('modal-active');\n    }, 50);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <section className=\"resume-page\" id=\"main\">\n        <object\n          data=\"assets/files/Resume.pdf#view=FitH\"\n          type=\"application/pdf\"\n          className=\"resume-pdf\"\n        >\n          <embed\n            src=\"assets/files/Resume.pdf#view=FitH\"\n            type=\"application/pdf\"\n            className=\"resume-pdf\"\n          />\n        </object>\n      </section>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default About;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport $ from 'jquery';\n\nimport './Projects.css';\n\nclass Projects extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      const wrapper = $('#wrapper');\n      wrapper.removeClass('is-loading');\n      const body = $('body');\n      body.removeClass('modal-active');\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        const key = window.location.hash.split('#')[2];\n        if (key) {\n          $('#main').animate(\n            {\n              scrollTop:\n                $('#main')[0].scrollTop + $('#' + key).position().top - 20\n            },\n            500\n          );\n        }\n      }, 150);\n    }, 50);\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    const key = window.location.hash.split('#')[2];\n    if (key) {\n      $('#main').animate(\n        {\n          scrollTop: $('#main')[0].scrollTop + $('#' + key).position().top - 20\n        },\n        500\n      );\n    } else {\n      $('#main').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 500);\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <section className=\"project-page\" id=\"main\">\n        <h1 id=\"personal\">\n          <b>Personal Projects</b>\n        </h1>\n        <h4 id=\"basic_user_app\">Basic User App</h4>\n        <p>\n          More recently, I've noticed a shift in the projects I try to develop.\n          The scope of the projects I want to build I want to actually be\n          usable. So I decided to build a basic user authentication system that\n          I can reuse and rehash for whatever purpose.\n          <br />\n          In general, this is a pretty basic application, it is pretty much a\n          web development exercise. It's a simple system that allows user\n          signups, stores credentials securely, and is easily scalable to\n          include additional functionality (that's what was important to me).\n          The app is built with Node.js and Express.js using a SQLite database\n          (I can't believe I don't utilize SQLite more for my projects because\n          it is so simple to setup and use cross platform). The front end is\n          pretty much just React taken from my personal site, I will definitely\n          be cleaning it up some more.\n          <br />\n          Overall a very enjoyable little project to build. I am also planning\n          to add the functionality of a user being allowed to have multiple\n          emails, and having to verify those emails along with modifying user\n          information.\n        </p>\n        <h4 id=\"personal_site\">Personal Site</h4>\n        <p>\n          This site actually turned out to be a much bigger undertaking than I\n          initially thought it would be.\n          <br />\n          In the beginning, I started out with a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n          template from HTML5 Up (Identity). This gave me an extremely solid\n          starting point both aesthetically and functionally as a common vertex\n          between my other profiles and was easy to deploy on Github Pages.\n          However, the template I started out with didn't provide me with all\n          the behavior I wanted the site to possess. So I found a couple more\n          templates from HTML5 Up (Escape Velocity, Phantom, and Multiverse).\n          Escape Velocity gave me a nice navbar to build off of using the jQuery\n          dropotron library, Phantom gave me a nice grid layout for my\n          photography, and Multiverse provided me a nice starting point to use\n          the jQuery poptrox library.\n          <br />\n          From here I realized that building this website using only HTML, CSS,\n          and JavaScript was a terrible idea. I wanted the smooth seamless\n          experience of a single page application which would've been miles\n          rougher to build with just those tools. With some research I found\n          that Node.js has a gh-pages plugin that automatically build and\n          deploys React applications for Github Pages. With some fiddling around\n          I was able to get this working on my chen-daniel.github.io repository\n          master branch (the plugin defaults to deploy on a gh-pages branch).\n          <br />\n          Now I began migrating what I'd already built from my previous files\n          into my new React project. There was a certain amount of loopholes I\n          had to find. For example, the React HashRouter helped me get around\n          some routing issues that Github Pages would introduce. The responsive\n          designs of the templates also had to be reworked, I had to properly\n          learn how to use CSS to format the page how I wanted for every size. I\n          also wanted to maintain my CSS transitions between pages, so I had to\n          make some modifications on my Links. Though the setup process for\n          moving my site into React was somewhat tedious, it paid off as making\n          changes to my app began to move much quicker. Changes propagated\n          across similar elements and making everything modular became a smooth\n          process.\n          <br />\n          Overall, this project gave me a lot more confidence in my front end\n          development. I was able to learn a lot more of the tips and tricks\n          around CSS, and gain a lot of practice in React.\n        </p>\n        <h4 id=\"home_automation\">Home Automation</h4>\n        <p>\n          The backstory of this project involves the apartment I moved into in\n          the fall of 2017. This apartment was great, but for some reason lacked\n          any ceiling lights in any of the rooms beyond the kitchen. So during\n          out furnishing shopping spree to IKEA, we had to purchase several\n          floor lamps to light every room. Our final setup had 3 several lamps\n          around our living room, and 2 lamps in each bedroom on opposite\n          corners. This introduced quite a large inefficiency in our lives with\n          having to walk around the room each time we needed to turn on our shut\n          off lights.\n          <br />\n          This quickly got pretty tiring, and I started to do research on how we\n          could improve this. There were several reasons why I didn't opt for\n          the immediately obvious choice of existing home automating solutions,\n          but most importantly I was just very interested in how these solutions\n          worked and what technologies they were built on.\n          <br />\n          My research began with what wireless options were available. Between\n          Wifi, Bluetooth, and RF, I decided to go for the RF option as RF\n          controlled outlets were more easily accessible and controllable than\n          bluetooth and Wifi solutions. The 433 MHz frequency seemed to be the\n          best option for its range and strength through walls. I purchased a\n          set of Etekcity RF outlets with this information that came with their\n          own remote. This worked out great as I put a remote in each room where\n          light switches normally would be, and they controlled the outlets in\n          each room. This was a great starting point.\n          <br />I was of course not satisfied with just this much. I decided to\n          move further and make these outlets voice controlled. Firstly I had to\n          move control of these outlets off of the remotes. I used an ESP8266\n          microcontroller wired to a 433MHz receiver to first read the signals\n          being sent from our remote to our outlets, copy them, and then send\n          the same signals from our 433Mhz transmitter. With this set up, I used\n          the built in web server properties of the ESP8266 to create an API on\n          our home network. From here, I used Google Home to read my voice, the\n          result is piped through to the IFTTT app, which then makes a web\n          request to our server to switch on and off the lights. I ran into a\n          problem here where the IFTTT app required our API to be open to the\n          Internet. It was easily resolved by port forwarding with our router.\n          Fingers crossed no security concerns come up!\n        </p>\n        <h1 id=\"hackathon\">\n          <b>Hackathon Projects</b>\n        </h1>\n        <h4 id=\"divvi\">divvi</h4>\n        <img\n          class=\"project-img\"\n          src=\"/assets/images/Projects/divvi.gif\"\n          alt=\"\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          Built over a day during BostonHacks 2018. This project was part one of\n          an app that addresses the difficulty in splitting the bill. Apps like\n          Venmo, Circle Pay, Square Cash, Zelle, and so on all address the\n          problem of money transfer, but as a college student who can't afford\n          to tank the bill, there is still an annoyance in the sector of\n          splitting the bill, or seperating grocery expenses where we must pull\n          out a calculator and calculate how much each person owes. This app's\n          goal is to streamline that process. Users create or join groups and\n          someone takes a photo of their receipt, and choose a method of\n          splitting the check. Methods include splitting evenly, allowing the\n          uploader to assign other members to certain items on the receipt, or\n          the members can select what they are paying for. Once all the sections\n          are split, the app will calculate how much everyone owes and\n          automatically request that amount from each member.

The original\n          conception had the app sending out Venmo requests automatically.\n          Something like that would've been great because it would've allowed us\n          to focus on the receipt aspect and just reference Venmo users.\n          However, we didn't find any ability to OAuth with Venmo, so ultimately\n          we decided we needed our own user engine. Using my basic user app, we\n          built on top of that. We used the Tesseract OCR to read receipts and\n          split the lines and prices. It worked extremely well, I was actually\n          so impressed with the outcome. Sadly, BostonHacks (around 22 hours)\n          didn't give us the time we needed to get a full prototype, only\n          managing to get us as far as building both the user system and receipt\n          reader, then integrating them together. This is a project I will\n          definitely continue to work on and will keep updated.\n        </p>\n        <h4 id=\"lingo\">linGO</h4>\n        <img\n          class=\"project-img\"\n          src=\"/assets/images/Projects/lingo.gif\"\n          alt=\"\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          This project was built over a weekend during HackHarvard 2018. The\n          goal of this project was to build an on-demand translator app. The\n          inspiration for this app arose from one of our group members sharing\n          about how their parents once had to stay on call for several hours\n          while their grandparents were in the hospital seeing a doctor, so that\n          they could act as a translator. We saw this project as something that\n          could be extremely beneficial for users. Our team for this hackathon\n          included\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/Shinabel\"> Abel Shin,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonyip/\"> Brandon Yip,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://abbyko.github.io/\"> Abby Ko,</a> and\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/kiminlee2000225\"> Kimin Lee.</a>\n          <br />\n          We developed this app with a very different set of tools. As one of\n          the event sponsors was Wix, they wanted us to use Wix Code as our\n          development platform. This was a new experience to all of us and had\n          some interesting effects on our process and our product. Instead of\n          jumping into development, we had to do a lot of research first about\n          how the platform worked and dive into it's documentation. After that,\n          we found a huge limitation to be the lack of ability to work on the\n          same project altogether. So we ended up splitting up. With one team\n          working on the design of our site and the other working on the backend\n          side. We spent a good deal of time trying to figure out the best way\n          to do user authentication with Wix Code because there was a built in\n          user engine but we didn't like everything it provided and also felt it\n          was missing some functionality. The last few hours of the hackathon\n          was spent taking all our work on the backend and integrating it into\n          our designers' work.\n          <br />\n          First of all, on Wix Code, our developers and our designers had very\n          different reactions to the platform. Our designers found it to be so\n          much easier than coding a page from scratch. Their drag and drop\n          interface works extremely well and it's very easy to get things to\n          work the way you want. On the other hand, our developers were\n          continually frustrated with the limitations that Wix Code had. We had\n          restrictions on libraries and packages that we could use, we found the\n          database to be overly difficult to utilize, the user system was also\n          confusing and some of the user libraries seemed to outright not work\n          (Wix Code was still in Beta at this point). Thus we had to build the\n          user and session token system from scratch.\n          <br />\n          Working with this platform did force me to think outside the box and\n          lower my reliability on packages and libraries. I implemented an\n          in-browser peer to peer calling system using WebRTC. This was really\n          interesting to build but again constantly ran into roadblocks with Wix\n          Code. Firstly, I needed to have custom HTML added to our page. Wix\n          Code doesn't allow any interactions with their generated HTML.\n          Instead, I had to embed this code into an IFrame that can't interact\n          with any outside code, which initially should've been fine. However,\n          Chrome now does not allow IFrames to be given access to things like\n          the microphone or audio without that permission being given in the\n          IFrame. Sadly, Wix Code didn't allow me to interact with the IFrame.\n          To get around this, I needed to add some JavaScript to the main page\n          that would add the properties to the IFrame on load. Wix Code doesn't\n          provide any of that kind of functionality. Instead, I found that\n          behind a paid subscription, I could get it to run custom code on the\n          HTML (originally for data collection purposes). With this I was able\n          to write a quick script that would add the permission parameters to\n          the IFrame whenever it was added to the DOM.\n          <br />I feel like I got to learn a lot about how to develop a\n          hackathon project through this one. Our design-work looked really\n          nice, but we let it pull too much focus from our project. Our user\n          authentication service was both a time drain, and unnecessary. We\n          should've prototyped the important features of our app first, and had\n          the extra information put somewhere else. Our app first and foremost\n          should've connected users searching for a translator to find someone\n          who could translate for them. This is what's important for a\n          presentation. The extra information would be helpful for potential\n          users, but that shouldn't have been something we were worried about in\n          this first build. The user system was also unnecessary bulk because it\n          just distracted from what our true purpose is supposed to be, though\n          it was pretty cool to work on.

Our team for this hackathon\n          included\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/Shinabel\"> Abel Shin,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://ctlnwng.github.io/\"> Caitlin Wang,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-c/\"> Elizabeth Cho,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonyip/\"> Brandon Yip,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://abbyko.github.io/\"> Abby Ko,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mo-alice/\"> Alice Mo,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericjichung/\"> Eric Chung,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-chan-a80372109/\">\n            {' '}\n            Jeffrey Chan,\n          </a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-kim-741b96149/\">\n            {' '}\n            Austin Kim,\n          </a>{' '}\n          and\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/duk-hwan-kim/\"> Duk Hwan Kim.</a>\n          <br />\n          My team for this hackathon was several friends who we'd successfully\n          convinced to sign up. I've been a pretty strong advocate for\n          hackathons since I've been able to both learn and apply so much new\n          knowledge through them. For several of these people, this was their\n          first hackathon and may have also been their first time coding outside\n          of a classroom so with this team, I adopted a leadership role, making\n          sure that my priority was in making sure everyone had something to\n          work on, and knew where we were moving on the project.\n          <br />\n          Our final product came out looking very good. Our front end designer\n          did an amazing job and our back-end was solid and with more time\n          could've had all loose ends tied up. We built the app using the Flask\n          framework, this was new to most of our team so they all had a chance\n          to learn both Flask and Python. The flow of our app started with a\n          home page with an upload button. Upon uploading a photo, we feed the\n          photo to Google's vision API which generates several tags. We first\n          take the most prominent tag and generate a GIF using the Giphy API.\n          The user is then forwarded to a loading screen with the GIF. The GIF\n          loading screen enhances the user-experience over just sitting and\n          waiting on the upload screen. While the user is enjoying the loading\n          screen and GIF, our back-end goes to work. It scrapes certain webpages\n          dynamically based on the tags generated. It then compiles a list of\n          suggestions and returns the results back to the user on completion. It\n          also presents the tags as hashtag suggestions for the social media\n          posts.\n          <br />\n          Given more time, we definitely would've wanted to improve the flow by\n          improving efficiency and maybe add caching to improve the search\n          times. We also would've wanted to add more pages and options to\n          generate captions from.\n          <br />\n          Personally, I can see that I have a lot of room for improvement as a\n          leader. Though I think everyone was able to contribute or learn\n          throughout the entire process, I struggled to communicate some ideas\n          as well as I could have which made it harder for others to implement\n          it or unsure of what they were doing. I'm definitely extremely proud\n          of everyone on the team that came together to create this project and\n          the outcome!\n        </p>\n        <h4 id=\"argot\">ARgot</h4>\n        <p>\n          This project was built over a weekend during WHACK 2017 where it won\n          the Most Entrepreneurial Hack prize from Rough Draft Ventures. For\n          this project, our goal was an augmented reality iOS app that could\n          assist in language learning by providing a nice interface where\n          recognized items are translated into a foreign language, then natural\n          phrases in the chosen language would be generated as well along with\n          recordings of the phrase being spoken in the chosen language. Our team\n          for this hackathon included\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliyatoday/\">\n            {' '}\n            Aliyah Tyshkanbayeva,\n          </a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriayang3/\">\n            {' '}\n            Victoria Yang,\n          </a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtamvu/\"> Minh Tâm Vũ,</a> and\n          <a href=\"https://abbyko.github.io/\"> Abby Ko.</a>\n          <br />\n          For this project, I worked on the back-end of our app with Victoria.\n          Our back-end was a web-api built in Flask that scraped and compiled\n          translations from multiple dictionaries, then generated a common JSON\n          response. It then also used Google Translate's text-to-speech engine\n          to generate recordings for each of the translations. Deploying this to\n          AWS was also a new challenge for us. With very little knowledge of\n          servers and Linux debugging at this point, we had to do a lot of\n          research together to eventually figure it out.\n        </p>\n        <h4 id=\"dangerzone\">DangerZone</h4>\n        <p>\n          This project was built over a weekend during BostonHacks 2017. This\n          project was geared towards residents in the Greater Boston area. It\n          provided various safety statistics given a specific location in the\n          city. During this hackathon, I worked with\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/Shinabel\"> Abel Shin,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-wong-7222107b/\">\n            {' '}\n            Tim Wong,\n          </a>\n          <a href=\"https://abbyko.github.io/\"> Abby Ko,</a> and\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericjichung/\"> Eric Chung.</a>\n          <br />\n          For this project, after initial ideation, I mainly worked on the\n          front-end of our app. This was mostly pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript\n          work. After that was setup, I worked on deploying the app with Heroku\n          and ran into several issues. We originally built the app with MongoDB,\n          however Heroku wanted us to use a different database. We were unable\n          to deploy in time for presentation though we finally got it to work\n          later after the hackathon.\n          <br />\n          Additional functionality we wanted to add was to use the Twilio API\n          that would allow a user to text a number which would then inform us of\n          the users location and provide them with the statistics at that\n          position.\n        </p>\n        <h4 id=\"iceboxme\">Icebox.me</h4>\n        <p>\n          This project was built over a weekend during HackUMass 2016. The\n          concept of this project was a reverse recipe site which would generate\n          recipes based on available ingredients. This was the first hackathon I\n          ever attended so I went in with very little knowledge aside from basic\n          command line Java apps. During this hackathon, I worked with\n          <a href=\"https://ellenlowing.github.io/\"> Ellen Lo</a> and\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cj-moynihan-366ab9b0/\">\n            {' '}\n            CJ Moynihan.\n          </a>\n          <br />\n          For this project I worked with CJ on our back-end. We started off by\n          writing a python script to recursively scrape a recipe site into our\n          own sqlite database. This also separated recipe instructions from\n          ingredient requirements. We then used the Bottle framework to build\n          our web application. Based on user inputted ingredients, the app finds\n          a list of recipes that can be made with the given ingredients. We ran\n          into some issues where ingredients were listed differently on\n          different recipes so we had to normalize the amount.\n          <br />\n          With most of this setup, I started to work with the Clarifai Image\n          Recognition API. The goal of this section was to build a recipe reader\n          that would add ingredients into the users ingredients. I used a python\n          library that could split an image of a recipe into individual images\n          of characters on the page. After successfully snipping several\n          samples, I fed them into the Clarifai API to develop a model to read\n          the text. It eventually reached about 80% accuracy. Though we didn't\n          get to finish this functionality, it was extremely interesting to work\n          on.\n        </p>\n        <h1 id=\"school\">\n          <b>School Projects</b>\n        </h1>\n        <h4 id=\"mcu_visualization\">MCU Visualization</h4>\n        <img class=\"project-img\" src=\"/assets/images/Projects/mcu.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n        <p>\n          This project was for my CS3200 Database Design class. For this project\n          I worked with\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/Shinabel\"> Abel Shin</a> and\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtamvu/\"> Minh Tâm Vũ.</a> The\n          assignment was to demonstrate all 4 database transactions in an\n          application of our choice on a data domain of our choice. We decided\n          to make a visualization of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we thought\n          it would create some interesting models and also contain a lot of\n          interesting information.\n          <br />\n          We used the D3.js library for our data visualization which allowed us\n          to make really visually interesting models. Our back-end was built in\n          Flask and a MySQL database. A lot of the info in our database was\n          manually populated. In order to fulfill the requirement of using the\n          different database transactions, we also added an admin section. As an\n          admin, you are allowed to view all of the data and tables in a grid,\n          and also add or remove data points. After implementing this, it also\n          got much easier to add new data for new movies that came out.\n          <br />\n          This project gave me a lot of practice in building web applications\n          across the stack after getting to study it more in depth in Web\n          Development class. It also gave me a lot of practice with setting up a\n          good data schema. Our web application was also dynamic, not loading\n          all data at once which would take a long time, but loading it in\n          chunks as necessary with AJAX. Implementing that with our timeline was\n          a lot of fun. Overall I really enjoyed this project and the team I was\n          working with. We matched each other well and our result was really\n          impressive.\n        </p>\n        <h4 id=\"spoiled_tomatillos\">Spoiled Tomatillos</h4>\n        <p>\n          This was a semester-long project for my CS4500 Software Development\n          class. For this project, I worked with\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/Shinabel\"> Abel Shin,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://jayylok.com/\"> Jay Lok,</a>\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-morgan-8612a5121/\">\n            {' '}\n            Matthew Morgan,\n          </a>{' '}\n          and\n          <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-shei/\">\n            {' '}\n            Veronica Shei.\n          </a>{' '}\n          We were tasked with creating a web application called Spoiled\n          Tomatillos for our clients (the professor). The app was essentially a\n          social movie review website (It took us embarrassingly long to realize\n          that the title of the project was a play on Rotten Tomatoes).\n          <br />\n          During this project, we followed proper software development practice.\n          We setup a Jenkins pipeline to build and deploy our project for\n          continuous integration, tracked our tasks in sprints with Jira,\n          communicated with each other and had standup on Slack, and had\n          biweekly sprint reviews.\n          <br />\n          Our app was very successful and through the development I was given\n          exposure to proper development standards and practices. I worked\n          across the stack for most of the projects, doing several reworks of\n          our design on the front-end, movie recommendations and friend\n          functionality on the back-end, and building efficient and optimized\n          queries for movie recommendations in our database. My teammates were\n          also awesome to work with and I was able to learn a lot from each of\n          them in different areas.\n        </p>\n        <h4 id=\"web_dev_projects\">Web Dev Projects</h4>\n        <p>\n          Over the course of the semester in my CS4550 Web Development class, we\n          constantly built projects on our own Linux server. All of our projects\n          were built using the Phoenix framework and Elixir on the back-end, and\n          React and Bootstrap on the front-end. Throughout these projects we\n          constantly added new web development technologies such a websockets,\n          ajax, redux, security practices and single page application\n          functionality.\n          <br />\n          Examples of some of these projects included a Memory game, first built\n          completely on the front end, then modified to have the logic verified\n          on the back-end. We then built a multiplayer chess game that allowed\n          for an unlimited amount of rooms. And each room could have 2 players\n          and an unlimited amount of spectators. We also built a task tracker\n          with users similar to Github, with the ability to track issues and\n          assign tasks. We then converted that app into a single page\n          application. Finally we built a web application that acted as a review\n          site for anything. These reviews could be categorized and also\n          referenced reviews from other sites depending on the category (i.e\n          food, movies, services, etc.).\n          <br />\n          This class really helped me to fully understand so many of the\n          technologies and concepts that I'd been employing for so long at\n          hackathons. I got a much greater appreciation for web development and\n          the direction that this field is heading in from these projects.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default
