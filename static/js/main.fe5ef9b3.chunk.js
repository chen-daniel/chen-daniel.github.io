So I found a couple more templates from HTML5 Up (Escape Velocity, Phantom, and Multiverse).

I also wanted to maintain my CSS transitions between pages, so I had to make some modifications on my Links.

This worked out great as I put a remote in each room where light switches normally would be, and they controlled the outlets in each room. This was a great starting point.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"I was of course not satisfied with just this much. I decided to move further and make these outlets voice controlled. Firstly I had to move control of these outlets off of the remotes. I used an ESP8266 microcontroller wired to a 433MHz receiver to first read the signals being sent from our remote to our outlets, copy them, and then send the same signals from our 433Mhz transmitter. With this set up, I used the built in web server properties of the ESP8266 to create an API on our home network. From here, I used Google Home to read my voice, the result is piped through to the IFTTT app, which then makes a web request to our server to switch on and off the lights. I ran into a problem here where the IFTTT app required our API to be open to the Internet. It was easily resolved by port forwarding with our router.

This app's goal is to streamline that process. Users create or join groups and someone takes a photo of their receipt, and choose a method of splitting the check. Methods include splitting evenly, allowing the uploader to assign other members to certain items on the receipt, or the members can select what they are paying for.

We used the Tesseract OCR to read receipts and split the lines and prices. It worked extremely well, I was actually so impressed with the outcome. Sadly, BostonHacks (around 22 hours) didn't give us the time we needed to get a full prototype, only managing to get us as far as building both the user system and receipt reader, then integrating them together.

As one of the event sponsors was Wix, they wanted us to use Wix Code as our development platform. This was a new experience to all of us and had some interesting effects on our process and our product. Instead of jumping into development, we had to do a lot of research first about how the platform worked and dive into it's documentation. After that, we found a huge limitation to be the lack of ability to work on the same project altogether. So we ended up splitting up. With one team working on the design of our site and the other working on the backend side. We spent a good deal of time trying to figure out the best way to do user authentication with Wix Code because there was a built in user engine but we didn't like everything it provided and also felt it was missing some functionality.

Our designers found it to be so much easier than coding a page from scratch. Their drag and drop interface works extremely well and it's very easy to get things to work the way you want. On the other hand, our developers were continually frustrated with the limitations that Wix Code had. We had restrictions on libraries and packages that we could use, we found the database to be overly difficult to utilize, the user system was also confusing and some of the user libraries seemed to outright not work (Wix Code was still in Beta at this point). Thus we had to build the user and session token system from scratch.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"Working with this platform did force me to think outside the box and lower my reliability on packages and libraries. I implemented an in-browser peer to peer calling system using WebRTC. This was really interesting to build but again constantly ran into roadblocks with Wix Code. Firstly, I needed to have custom HTML added to our page. Wix Code doesn't allow any interactions with their generated HTML. Instead, I had to embed this code into an IFrame that can't interact with any outside code, which initially should've been fine. However, Chrome now does not allow IFrames to be given access to things like the microphone or audio without that permission being given in the IFrame. Sadly, Wix Code didn't allow me to interact with the IFrame. To get around this, I needed to add some JavaScript to the main page that would add the properties to the IFrame on load. Wix Code doesn't provide any of that kind of functionality. Instead, I found that behind a paid subscription, I could get it to run custom code on the HTML (originally for data collection purposes). With this I was able to write a quick script that would add the permission parameters to the IFrame whenever it was added to the DOM.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"I feel like I got to learn a lot about how to develop a hackathon project through this one.

Our app first and foremost should've connected users searching for a translator to find someone who could translate for them. This is what's important for a presentation. The extra information would be helpful for potential users, but that shouldn't have been something we were worried about in this first build.

Throughout these projects we constantly added new web development technologies such a websockets, ajax, redux, security practices and single page application functionality.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"Examples of some of these projects included a Memory game, first built completely on the front end, then modified to have the logic verified on the back-end. We then built a multiplayer chess game that allowed for an unlimited amount of rooms. And each room could have 2 players and an unlimited amount of spectators. We also built a task tracker with users similar to Github, with the ability to track issues and assign tasks. We then converted that app into a single page application. Finally we built a web application that acted as a review site for anything. These reviews could be categorized and also referenced reviews from other sites depending on the category (i.e food, movies, services, etc.).",o.a.createElement("br",null),"This class really helped me to fully understand so many of the technologies and concepts that I'd been employing for so long at hackathons.
