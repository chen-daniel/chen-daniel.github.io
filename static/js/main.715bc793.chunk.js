This was a great starting point.",o.a.createElement("br",null),"I was of course not satisfied with just this much. I decided to move further and make these outlets voice controlled. Firstly I had to move control of these outlets off of the remotes. I used an ESP8266 microcontroller wired to a 433MHz receiver to first read the signals being sent from our remote to our outlets, copy them, and then send the same signals from our 433Mhz transmitter. With this set up, I used the built in web server properties of the ESP8266 to create an API on our home network. From here, I used Google Home to read my voice, the result is piped through to the IFTTT app, which then makes a web request to our server to switch on and off the lights. I ran into a problem here where the IFTTT app required our API to be open to the Internet. It was easily resolved by port forwarding with our router.

On the other hand, our developers were continually frustrated with the limitations that Wix Code had. We had restrictions on libraries and packages that we could use, we found the database to be overly difficult to utilize, the user system was also confusing and some of the user libraries seemed to outright not work (Wix Code was still in Beta at this point).

Instead, I had to embed this code into an IFrame that can't interact with any outside code, which initially should've been fine. However, Chrome now does not allow IFrames to be given access to things like the microphone or audio without that permission being given in the IFrame. Sadly, Wix Code didn't allow me to interact with the IFrame. To get around this, I needed to add some JavaScript to the main page that would add the properties to the IFrame on load. Wix Code doesn't provide any of that kind of functionality. Instead, I found that behind a paid subscription, I could get it to run custom code on the HTML (originally for data collection purposes).

Our app first and foremost should've connected users searching for a translator to find someone who could translate for them. This is what's important for a presentation. The extra information would be helpful for potential users, but that shouldn't have been something we were worried about in this first build.
